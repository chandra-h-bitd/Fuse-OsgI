Cloning fabric git repository does not retrieve all versions

    Red Hat JBoss Fuse
        Version 6.1.0 GA
        Version 6.0.0 GA

Issue

In a Fuse fabric, the configuration can be copied and manipulated by cloning the fabric's git repository from an instance's HTTP port as follows:
Raw

git clone -b 1.0 http://admin:admin@localhost:8181/git/fabric

The branch (-b) indicates the profile version you wish to clone. 1.0 denotes the default profile version 1.0.

Executing version-create in the Fuse console creates a new branch in the git repository but, on some occasions, cloning the repository does not show all branches or, consequently, all versions of the fabric configuration.
Resolution

Before cloning the fabric repository, determine which fabric instance is currently playing the role of master git repository:
Raw

fabric:cluster-list | grep fabric-repo

Ensure that you only clone that particular repository. Any other instance will have a repository that might not be up to date.
Root Cause

The git repository is only updated from the distributed configuration held by the fabric's Apache Zookeeper infrastructure when a particular fabric instance takes over the role of master git repository. Only one instance will have that role at any given time. This is not considered to be a defect -- the fabric does not need multiple copies of the git repository, as the primary configuration store is in Zookeeper.

Future releases of Fuse will not expose the git repository of an instance that does not have the latest configuration, and this problem will be avoided.
